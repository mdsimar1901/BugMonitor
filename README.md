Abstraction

1)Bug Tracking System must be in place for every infrastructure we design. Software is no exception to this. This application which will be implemented on Java platform is designed to track the status of bugs that are reported during Software testing.


2)Bug tracking system is essentially and effectively implemented to monitor the status of bugs in an application. All the bugs that are identified are stored in a database. Each bug is assigned with an unique bug id and respective status of bug. Bugs can be created and updated with ease. Specific user accounts to control the access and maintain security are incorporated into the application.
